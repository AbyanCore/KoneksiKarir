# Company Profile Check & Navbar Updates - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 14, 2025

## Overview

Implemented company profile completion check (similar to job seeker profile check) and updated the navbar to show real user data with role-based navigation.

---

## 1. ✅ Company Profile Completion Check

### Added New Procedure: `checkMyCompanyProfileComplete`

**Location:** `src/server/routers/companies.ts`

**Purpose:** Check if company profile has required fields before accessing dashboard/hub

**Logic:**

```typescript
// Required fields for complete profile:
- company.name (must exist)
- company.description (must exist)
- company.location (must exist)
```

**Returns:**

```typescript
{
  isComplete: boolean,
  message: string,
  company?: Company
}
```

### Updated Pages with Profile Check

#### 1. Company Dashboard (`/s/company/dashboard`)

**Location:** `src/app/(routes)/s/company/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added profile completion check on page load
- If profile incomplete → redirect to `/s/company/profile`
- Show toast notification with message
- Only fetch dashboard data if profile is complete
- Show loading state while checking profile

**Flow:**

```
1. Page loads
2. Check if company profile is complete
3. If incomplete:
   - Show toast: "Please complete your company profile first"
   - Redirect to /s/company/profile
4. If complete:
   - Fetch and display dashboard data
```

#### 2. Hub Page (`/s/hub`)

**Location:** `src/components/dashboard/hub/index.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added company profile check for ADMIN_COMPANY users
- Redirect to company profile if incomplete
- Added loading state for company profile check
- Prevent rendering if company profile incomplete

**Flow:**

```
Job Seeker accessing hub:
1. Check job seeker profile
2. If incomplete → redirect to /s/profile
3. If complete → show hub

Company Admin accessing hub:
1. Check company profile
2. If incomplete → redirect to /s/company/profile
3. If complete → show hub
```

## 2. ✅ Navbar Updates with Real User Data

### Updated Component: `src/components/navbar.tsx`

**Changes:**

#### 1. Real User Data Integration

- Removed mock user data
- Integrated with `useAuth()` hook
- Show real email from session
- Generate username from email (before @ symbol)
- Generate initials from email

#### 2. Role-Based Navigation

**Job Seeker:**

```typescript
- Profile (icon: User) → /s/profile
- Activity (icon: Activity) → /s/activity
```

**Company Admin (ADMIN_COMPANY):**

```typescript
- Company Profile (icon: Building2) → /s/company/profile
- Company Dashboard (icon: LayoutDashboard) → /s/company/dashboard
```

**Admin & Other Roles:**

- No specific navigation items (only logout)

#### 3. User Display

- **Avatar:** Shows initials from email (e.g., "john@example.com" → "JO")
- **Name:** Shows username part of email (e.g., "john@example.com" → "john")
- **Email:** Shows full email address

#### 4. Other Improvements

- Added null check (don't render if not authenticated)
- Integrated with auth provider's `signOut()` method
- Fixed logo link to go to `/s/hub`
- Added new icons: `Building2`, `LayoutDashboard`

## 7. Database Requirements

### For Testing Profile Completion:

**Create test company with incomplete data:**

```sql
-- Create company with only name (missing description and location)
INSERT INTO "Company" (name, code, location, description)
VALUES ('Test Company', '123456', NULL, NULL);
```

**Create complete company:**

```sql
-- Create company with all required fields
INSERT INTO "Company" (name, code, location, description)
VALUES (
  'Complete Company',
  '789012',
  'Jakarta, Indonesia',
  'A fully complete company profile for testing'
);
```

## 8. Edge Cases Handled

### Profile Check:

1. **Company not found** → Shows message, redirects
2. **User not found** → Shows message, redirects
3. **Partial profile** → Redirects to profile page
4. **Complete profile** → Allows access

### Navbar:

1. **User not authenticated** → Navbar doesn't render
2. **Unknown role** → Shows navbar without nav items
3. **Missing email** → Falls back gracefully (won't crash)
