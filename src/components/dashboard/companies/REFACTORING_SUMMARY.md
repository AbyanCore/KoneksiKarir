# Companies Management - Refactoring Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Modular Component Architecture

Created 7 separate, reusable components in `components/dashboard/companies/`:

- `CompaniesHeader.tsx` - Header with title and add button
- `StatsCards.tsx` - Statistics display cards
- `SearchBar.tsx` - Search functionality
- `CompaniesGrid.tsx` - Company cards grid
- `CompanyFormSheet.tsx` - Form for create/edit (reusable)
- `DeleteConfirmSheet.tsx` - Delete confirmation dialog
- `CompanyDetailSheet.tsx` - Detailed company view
- `index.tsx` - Main orchestrator component

### 2. tRPC Integration

Replaced all mock data with real tRPC queries:

- **`findAllWithStats`** - Optimized query that fetches all companies with:

  - Job counts via `_count`
  - Event participation counts via `_count`
  - Application counts (calculated from nested jobs)
  - Single query, no N+1 problem

- **`findOneWithDetails`** - Fetches detailed company data when viewing:
  - All event participations
  - Jobs grouped by events
  - Application counts per job
  - Optimized with proper includes

### 3. New tRPC Queries Created

Added to `/server/routers/companies.ts`:

```typescript
findAllWithStats; // Get all companies with aggregated stats
findOneWithDetails; // Get company with full event/job details
```

### 4. DTO Updates

Updated `/lib/dtos/companies/create.company.dto.ts`:

- Added `code` field validation (6 characters, required)
- Made `description` and `location` required
- Maintained optional fields for `website` and `logoUrl`

### 5. Optimizations Applied

#### No N+1 Query Problems

- Single query fetches all companies with relations
- Application counts calculated in single pass
- Event details loaded only when viewing (conditional query)

#### Frontend Data Population

- Jobs are grouped by events in the frontend
- Application counts aggregated from job data
- Event participation transformed for UI display

#### Efficient Queries

```typescript
// Before: Multiple queries
companies.forEach(company => {
  fetch jobs for company
  fetch events for company
  fetch applications for each job
})

// After: Single optimized query
const companies = await prisma.company.findMany({
  include: {
    _count: { select: { jobs: true, EventCompanyParticipation: true } },
    jobs: { select: { id: true, Application: { select: { id: true } } } }
  }
});
```

### 6. Design Principles Applied

✅ **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**

- Each component has one clear purpose
- Header only handles header display
- Grid only handles company display
- Forms only handle form logic

✅ **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

- Components are straightforward
- Clear prop interfaces
- No over-engineering

✅ **Modular Architecture**

- Easy to test individual components
- Easy to replace/update components
- Reusable across the application

✅ **Optimized Queries**

- No N+1 problems
- Single queries where possible
- Conditional loading for heavy data

✅ **Frontend Population**

- Complex relationships handled in React
- Data transformation in useMemo
- Keeps backend queries simple

## 🎯 Key Features Preserved

- ✅ All layouts identical
- ✅ All functionality working
- ✅ All styles preserved
- ✅ Gradient backgrounds
- ✅ Hover effects
- ✅ Search filtering
- ✅ CRUD operations
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Code generation
- ✅ Event participation tracking
- ✅ Job listings with applicant counts
- ✅ Collapsible event details
- ✅ Toast notifications

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

1. **Database Queries**: Reduced from O(n\*m) to O(1) for listing
2. **Frontend Renders**: Optimized with useMemo hooks
3. **Data Loading**: Conditional loading for detail views
4. **State Management**: Centralized in index component

## 📝 Usage Example

```tsx
// Before: 1066 lines of code in page.tsx
// After: 4 lines in page.tsx

import CompaniesManagement from "@/components/dashboard/companies";

export default function Page_AdminCompanies() {
  return <CompaniesManagement />;
}
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Easy to find and fix issues
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested individually
3. **Reusability**: Components like SearchBar can be used elsewhere
4. **Performance**: Optimized queries prevent database bottlenecks
5. **Scalability**: Architecture supports future feature additions
6. **Clean Code**: Follows SOLID principles and best practices
