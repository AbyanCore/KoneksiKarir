# Quick Reference - Image Display

## ✅ All Fixed! Images Now Display Properly

### What Was Fixed?

1. **Event banners** - Now show uploaded images instead of gradient placeholders
2. **Company logos** - No longer hidden by overlapping icons
3. **Event minimaps** - Display full map images properly
4. **Inline viewing** - Images open in browser instead of downloading

      src={imageUrl}
      alt="Description"
      className="w-full h-full object-cover"
      onError={(e) => {
        (e.target as HTMLImageElement).style.display = "none";
      }}
    />
