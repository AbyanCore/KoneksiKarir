## Data Structure

### Company-User Relationship

**Current Implementation**: Email matching (simplified)

```typescript
company = await prisma.company.findFirst({
  where: {
    name: { contains: user.email.split("@")[0], mode: "insensitive" },
  },
});
```

**Production Recommendation**: Add proper FK relation in schema

```prisma
model User {
  companyId Int?
  company   Company? @relation(fields: [companyId], references: [id])
}

model Company {
  users User[]
}
```

### Application Status Flow

1. **PENDING** → Initial state when job seeker applies
2. **ACCEPTED** → Company accepts the application
3. **REJECTED** → Company rejects the application
4. **REVIEWED** → Application has been reviewed (future use)

Each status change creates an ApplicationHistory record for audit trail.
